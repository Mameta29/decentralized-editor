# Decentralized File Management Systemg

## 🚀 Vision

Imagine a world where your documents are not just collaboratively edited in real-time, but also stored in a decentralized manner, giving you true ownership and control over your data. Welcome to our project, where we're turning this vision into reality!

## 🌟 Project Highlights

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Powered by Liveblocks for smooth, Google Docs-like simultaneous editing
- **Decentralized Storage**: Leveraging BNB's Greenfield for secure, distributed document storage
- **Web3 Integration**: Seamlessly connecting blockchain technology with everyday document editing

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Liveblocks
- **Decentralized Storage**: BNB Greenfield
- **Blockchain Interaction**: ethers.js

## 🔍 Key Features

1. **Simultaneous Editing**: Multiple users can edit documents in real-time
2. **Decentralized Storage**: All documents are stored on BNB's Greenfield network
3. **Wallet Integration**: Connect with Web3 wallets for secure access
4. **Version History**: Track changes and revert to previous versions
5. **Access Control**: Granular permissions for document sharing and editing

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables (see `.env.example`)
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

We're not stopping here! Our vision for the future includes:

- Implementing CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) for even more robust collaboration
- Integrating Automerge for advanced synchronization protocols
- Incorporating IROH for true peer-to-peer connections
- Enhancing the permission system for more fine-grained access control

## 🏆 Hackathon Context

This project was developed as part of [Hackathon Name], where we aimed to revolutionize document editing by combining the power of real-time collaboration with the security and ownership benefits of decentralized storage.
